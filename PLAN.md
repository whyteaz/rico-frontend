# PLAN.md - AI Financial App Hackathon

## 1. Introduction

**Project Goal:** To develop an AI-powered financial web application tailored for users with low financial literacy within a 10-hour hackathon timeframe.
**Constraint:** 10-hour development sprint.

## 2. MVP Feature List (Prioritized)

1.  **Basic Vue.js Page Structure:**
    *   Chat Interface (default page)
    *   Dashboard Page
    *   Settings Page (minimal placeholder)
2.  **PDF Bank Statement Upload (Chat Interface):**
    *   Frontend component for file selection and upload.
3.  **Backend PDF Processing (Node.js & Alibaba Cloud):**
    *   API endpoint to receive PDF file (using `multer` or similar).
    *   Integration with Alibaba Cloud **`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest`** model from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio for OCR and text/data extraction from the PDF.
    *   Sending extracted data to Alibaba Cloud Qwen-Turbo-Latest model.
4.  **Chat Interaction (Qwen-Turbo-Latest):**
    *   Frontend chat interface to send user questions to the backend.
    *   Backend API endpoint to relay questions (with extracted PDF context) to Qwen-Turbo-Latest.
    *   Display AI responses in the chat interface.
5.  **Dashboard Display (Data from AI):**
    *   Qwen-Turbo-Latest generates JSON output summarizing financial health (e.g., total income, total expenses).
    *   Backend API endpoint to provide this JSON to the frontend.
    *   Frontend dashboard displays:
        *   Total income vs. expenses.
        *   Simple graph/chart (e.g., bar chart) summarizing income/expenses (using a lightweight Vue charting library).
6.  **User Authentication (Simplified for Hackathon):**
    *   Mock user or no authentication to save time. If implemented, keep it extremely basic (e.g., hardcoded user).
7.  **Deployment to Vercel:**
    *   Basic setup for Vercel deployment.

## 3. Architecture Overview

*   **Frontend (Vue.js):**
    *   `App.vue`: Main application shell, Vue Router setup.
    *   `ChatView.vue`: Handles chat interface, PDF upload component, communication with backend chat API.
    *   `DashboardView.vue`: Displays financial summary and charts, fetches data from backend dashboard API.
    *   `SettingsView.vue`: Minimal placeholder.
    *   `PdfUpload.vue` (component): Reusable component for file upload.
    *   `SimpleChart.vue` (component): Reusable component for displaying charts (e.g., using Chart.js or a similar lightweight library).
    *   API Service Module: Centralized place for API calls to the backend.
*   **Backend (Node.js with Express.js):**
    *   `server.js` / `index.js`: Main server setup.
    *   API Endpoints:
        *   `POST /api/upload-pdf`: Handles PDF file upload, calls Alibaba Cloud **`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest`** model, then Qwen-Turbo-Latest for initial processing or context setting.
        *   `POST /api/chat`: Receives user messages, interacts with Qwen-Turbo-Latest (with context from PDF).
        *   `GET /api/dashboard-data`: Provides JSON data (generated by Qwen-Turbo-Latest) for the dashboard.
    *   Service Modules:
        *   `alibabaCloudService.js`: Contains logic to interact with Alibaba Cloud SDKs (**`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest`**, Qwen-Turbo-Latest).
        *   `pdfProcessingService.js`: Handles logic related to data extracted from PDFs.
*   **Alibaba Cloud Services:**
    *   **`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest` (via Model Studio):** For OCR and structured data extraction from PDF bank statements.
    *   **Qwen-Turbo-Latest (via Model Studio):** For natural language understanding, answering financial questions, and generating JSON summaries for the dashboard.

## 4. Technology Choices

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Vue.js 3 (Composition API for simplicity and organization).
    *   Vue Router for page navigation.
    *   Charting Library: `Chart.js` (lightweight, easy to integrate with Vue, e.g., via `vue-chartjs` wrapper if simple).
    *   CSS: Basic styling, possibly a micro CSS framework like Pico.css or Tailwind CSS (if setup is quick) for a clean look, otherwise custom minimal CSS.
*   **Backend:**
    *   Node.js (latest LTS version).
    *   Express.js for routing and API creation.
    *   `multer` for handling `multipart/form-data` (file uploads).
*   **Alibaba Cloud Integration:**
    *   Alibaba Cloud SDK for Node.js.
        *   For **Qwen-Turbo-Latest**: Utilize the appropriate SDK or REST API provided by Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Research the simplest method for API key authentication and request sending.
        *   For **`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest`**: Utilize the appropriate SDK or REST API provided by Alibaba Cloud Model Studio for PDF processing. Research the simplest method for API key authentication and request sending for PDF data extraction.
*   **PDF Handling (Backend):**
    *   `multer` for receiving the upload.
    *   The actual parsing/extraction is delegated to Alibaba Cloud **`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest`**.

## 5. High-Level 10-Hour Timeline

*   **Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure (1.5 hours)**
    *   (0.5 hr) Initialize Vue.js project, Node.js/Express backend project.

    *   (1 hr) Implement PDF upload endpoint (`/api/upload-pdf`) using `multer`.
    *   (1 hr) Research and integrate Alibaba Cloud **`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest`** SDK/API: Send PDF, retrieve text/data.
    *   (1 hr) Research and integrate Alibaba Cloud Qwen-Turbo-Latest SDK/API: Basic "hello world" style interaction.

    *   (0.5 hr) Prepare for Vercel deployment (add `vercel.json` if needed), deploy, and test.

## 6. Simplification Strategy

*   **No Database:** All data processing is session-based. No persistent user data storage beyond the current interaction.
*   **Minimal Authentication:** If implemented, use a mock user or no authentication.
*   **Limited Error Handling:** Focus on the "happy path." Basic error handling for critical API calls (e.g., to Alibaba Cloud), but not exhaustive.
*   **Basic UI/UX:** Functional but not polished. Use standard HTML elements and minimal CSS. Avoid complex animations or UI interactions.
*   **Scoped Financial Analysis:** The AI will answer basic questions and provide simple summaries (income vs. expense). No complex financial advice, forecasting, or detailed transaction categorization.
*   **Single PDF Upload:** Assume one bank statement PDF per "session" or interaction for simplicity. No handling of multiple statements or merging data.
*   **Hardcoded Prompts (Initial):** Initial prompts for Qwen-Turbo-Latest (e.g., for JSON generation or summarization) can be hardcoded and refined if time permits.
*   **Focus on Core MVP:** Strictly adhere to the prioritized MVP feature list. De-scope `Settings` page functionality if time is short.

## 7. Next Steps After Plan Approval

1.  **Setup Projects:** Initialize the Vue.js frontend and Node.js/Express backend projects.
2.  **Basic Routing/Components:** Create the basic page structure and routing in Vue.js (Chat, Dashboard, Settings placeholders).
3.  **Backend Server:** Set up the initial Express server with placeholder API endpoints.
4.  **Research Alibaba SDKs:** Confirm the exact Node.js SDKs and simplest API usage patterns for Qwen-Turbo-Latest and **`Qwen-VL-Max-Latest`** (for PDF extraction). Secure API keys/credentials.
