# Chat Integration Summary

Date: 2025-05-17

## Overview

The chat functionality in the AI Financial App frontend has been updated to integrate with a new, unified chat API endpoint: `http://47.236.92.42:8000/chat`. This single endpoint now handles both text-based chat messages and PDF file uploads (for bank statement analysis).

## Affected Component

*   **[`ai-financial-app/frontend/src/views/ChatView.vue`](ai-financial-app/frontend/src/views/ChatView.vue:0)**

## Changes Made

1.  **API Endpoint Update:**
    *   A constant `NEW_API_ENDPOINT` was defined in [`ChatView.vue`](ai-financial-app/frontend/src/views/ChatView.vue:0) holding the URL `http://47.236.92.42:8000/chat`.
    *   The `handleFileUpload` method was modified to send PDF files (as `FormData`) to this new endpoint via a `POST` request.
    *   The `sendChatMessage` method was modified to send user text messages (as a JSON payload) to this new endpoint via a `POST` request.

2.  **Assumptions:**
    *   The new API endpoint (`http://47.236.92.42:8000/chat`) is capable of differentiating between `FormData` (for file uploads) and JSON payloads (for text messages) or has internal logic to handle both request types appropriately.
    *   The request methods (`POST`) and basic payload structures (`FormData` for files, JSON for text) are compatible with the new API's contract.

## Unit Testing

*   A new unit test file, [`ai-financial-app/frontend/src/views/__tests__/ChatView.spec.js`](ai-financial-app/frontend/src/views/__tests__/ChatView.spec.js:0), was created.
*   The tests (written in a Vitest-like style) cover:
    *   Successful PDF upload to the new endpoint.
    *   Successful text message sending to the new endpoint.
    *   Basic error handling for API responses.
*   **Note:** These tests require a test runner (e.g., Vitest) and Vue Test Utils to be set up in the frontend project to be executable.

## Future Considerations

*   If the project grows, the API endpoint URL and `fetch` logic could be abstracted into a dedicated API service module (e.g., `src/services/api.js`) as originally envisioned in [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md:44), rather than being handled directly within the component.
*   More detailed error handling and user feedback mechanisms can be implemented based on specific API error responses.
