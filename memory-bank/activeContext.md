## Current Focus

* Integrating an external Qwen chat API for file upload and chat services, replacing current local backend calls. This involves modifying [`ChatView.vue`](ai-financial-app/frontend/src/views/ChatView.vue:0) and [`api.js`](ai-financial-app/frontend/src/services/api.js:0).

## Recent Changes

* [2025-05-18 01:08:29] - Memory Bank initialized.
* [2025-05-18 01:08:29] - `productContext.md` populated from `PLAN.md`.
* [2025-05-18 01:18:26] - `productContext.md` updated to reflect Qwen external API integration.

## Open Questions/Issues

* What are the specific Qwen API endpoints for file upload and chat?
* What is the expected request/response format for these Qwen API endpoints?
* How is authentication handled with the Qwen API?
* How does the Qwen file upload relate to the chat context (e.g., file ID usage)?
